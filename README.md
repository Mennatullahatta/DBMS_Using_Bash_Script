# DBMS Using Bash Script

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **Database Management System (DBMS)** that allows users to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve data from the hard disk. The system provides a simple interface for interacting with the data stored locally on the machine, simulating the basic operations of a traditional DBMS.
